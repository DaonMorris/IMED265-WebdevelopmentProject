				Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (audio speaker iconlisten)) is 
hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. In Japan and 
in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) 
describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. However, 
outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese 
animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] 
Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese 
animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.

					Modern anime follows a typical animation production process, 
involving storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel 
production. Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer 
animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. Early 
anime works were experimental, and consisted of images drawn on 
blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette 
animation.[40][41] Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to 
dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation 
techniques is mostly limited to independent short films,[42] including 
the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, 
Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata.[43][44] Computers were 
integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as 
Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with 
computer-generated images.[45] Fuji Film, a major cel production 
company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry 
panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital 
processes.[45]
